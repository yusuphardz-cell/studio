/**
 * This ruleset governs the LigaManager application's Firestore database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is designed for public read access. Write operations
 * are currently open to allow for prototyping and development.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically. A top-level 'leagues' collection holds all
 * league documents. Each league document contains 'participants' and 'matches'
 * subcollections, creating a clear and isolated data tree for each league.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All collections ('leagues', 'participants', 'matches') are configured
 *   to be publicly readable by anyone. This supports the primary use case of displaying
 *   league information on a website.
 * - Writes Enabled for Prototyping: To facilitate development, write operations
 *   (`create`, `update`, `delete`) are currently allowed. In a production environment,
 *   these rules would need to be updated with an ownership model to restrict writes
 *   to authorized users (e.g., league admins).
 * - No User-Specific Data: There are no user-specific collections (e.g., /users/{userId}),
 *   as the current model does not involve user accounts managing data.
